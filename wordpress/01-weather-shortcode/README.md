# WordPress Developer Test

This test should provide you with the opportunity to demonstrate your WordPress development skills as well as your capabilities with PHP.

## We are keen to see how the following is handled:

* Code location (e.g. will it be a theme, plugin etc.)
* Documentation of your code
* How your solution could be extended
* Separation of concerns
* Server performance
* Usage of WordPress hooks

## The Brief

We want to use the following shortcode to display information about the weather on a series of WordPress websites:

`[finder_weather city="Sydney"]`

The shortcode will need to display a table with the following information for the calendar year:

* Month
* Monthly average
* Change from last Month

### What we want to render

Weather for Sydney

| Month | Av Temp | Change  |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| Jan   | 32.8    | +2      |
| Feb   | 31.5    | -1.3    |
